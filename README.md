# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the application of engineering methods, principles and tools to produce high quiality software sytems. It enables the creation of software applications and systems that make work much easierfor example in communication, entertainment, etc.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages
Establishment of software engineering as a discipline
Rise of agile methodologies

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Get to know and document user needs and requirements
Design: Create high level design of the software architecture and user interface.
Implentation: based on the design, write code and start building the application
Testing: Conduct test to determine if the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: After the testing, release the software to be used by users.
Maintenance: Providing support, updates and enhancements to application to make it better by day.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a sequential approach with distinct phases for example in designing an Enterprise Resource Planning ssystem while agile is an iterartive and incremental approach for example development of a mobile app application.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
writing code and implementing software solutions, ensure software quality by designing and executing software tests plans, responsible for overseeing planning, execution and delivery of software systems respectively.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code for example visual studio and VCSs track changes to source code and coordinates work among team members for example Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements, tight schedules and technical debt. Some strategies to overcome these are; effective communication, prioritization of tasks and regular assessment of project goals and objectives.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Types of testing: unit, integration, system and acceptance testing.
Importance: Identify defects early in the development process and leading to higher quality softwares.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting inputs to give an AI model to ensure you get accurate answers in regards to what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Explain houses(vague)
Explain the process of building a bungalow step by step.
